00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:01,418
(low music throughout)

2
00:00:01,606 --> 00:00:03,383
What is alternative text?

3
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:10,129
Alternative text, also known as "alt text,"

4
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:12,106
is descriptive text that conveys

5
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:14,844
the meaning of an image in digital content.

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,655
It's designed to make visual content accessible

7
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:19,731
to people with vision disabilities.

8
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:22,163
While there are other benefits of alt text

9
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:24,780
for all users, this video focuses

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,876
on people who use screen readers.

11
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:29,430
When a person uses a screen reader,

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,604
the screen reader will read the on-screen text aloud

13
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:35,118
using text-to-speech technology.

14
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,136
When the screen reader reaches an image,

15
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,642
it will announce that it has detected an image

16
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:41,793
and read the alt text for that image

17
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,509
so the user can know what the image

18
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,018
is meant to convey.

19
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:48,122
Without alt text, people who use screen readers

20
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:49,905
cannot access the information

21
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:51,641
provided in the images.

22
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:54,000
This is why alt text is a requirement

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,934
in the Section 508 Standards

24
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,671
for creating digital content.

25
00:00:58,431 --> 00:00:59,913
Different authoring tools will have

26
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:02,222
different ways of adding alt text.

27
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:04,641
For example, to add alt text to an image

28
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:07,602
in Microsoft Word, open the contextual menu,

29
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,764
or right-click menu, of the image.

30
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,968
Next, select "View Alt Text,"

31
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:15,130
then enter text that appropriately describes

32
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,339
the image and communicates its purpose.

33
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:20,904
When writing alt text, follow these guidelines

34
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:22,818
to ensure the text is as helpful

35
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:24,695
and meaningful as possible.

36
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:26,754
(whoosh)

37
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:29,161
If an image is only decorative,

38
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,854
and does not convey meaningful information,

39
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:34,935
set the alt text as decorative so that screen readers

40
00:01:34,935 --> 00:01:36,673
recognize that the image does not need

41
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,794
to be announced and can be skipped.

42
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:41,453
In Microsoft Word, you can do this

43
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:43,719
by viewing the alt text and checking the box

44
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,359
that says, "Mark as decorative."

45
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,535
Any program you use should also have

46
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:51,132
its own specific guidance on how to do this.

47
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:52,583
(whoosh)

48
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:56,535
Avoid using default or AI-generated alt text,

49
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:58,286
since these descriptions usually

50
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,469
do not communicate the actual purpose

51
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,772
of the image. For example,

52
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,653
an AI may describe a screenshot of a form

53
00:02:05,653 --> 00:02:08,015
as "screenshot of a phone screen."

54
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,503
However, if the image is intended to show

55
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:13,352
how to use the form, the alt text will need

56
00:02:13,352 --> 00:02:15,677
to describe the content of the screenshot

57
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,460
to make the description meaningful.

58
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:19,131
(whoosh)

59
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,958
If you have an image or logo

60
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,763
that contains text, make sure the alt text

61
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:26,429
repeats that text word for word.

62
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:30,109
For example, for this logo of section508.gov,

63
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:33,288
the alt text says, "GSA logo with text.

64
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:35,136
"section508 dot gov.

65
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,979
"Buy. Build. Be accessible."

66
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,851
(whoosh)

67
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,157
Keep your descriptions short and focused

68
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:42,936
on the purpose of the image.

69
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:44,278
Avoid repeating information

70
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:46,533
that is already in the main text,

71
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,060
and don't use unnecessary phrases like,

72
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,493
"this is a photo of," or descriptions

73
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:53,918
of irrelevant details in the image.

74
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:56,177
For example, if your image is designed

75
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,955
to show how a ramp helps wheelchair users,

76
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:00,967
you do not need to include an in-depth

77
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:03,372
description of the wheelchair user's clothes

78
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:05,621
or physical appearance in your alt text.

79
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:07,607
(whoosh)

80
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:10,755
